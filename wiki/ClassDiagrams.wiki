= Initial Class Diagram =

Initially, I'm planning to implement all the hard work on the Board and Game classes. As it's being written in C#, it will use events for game operations.

= Class Diagram update (7 Aug 2010) =

Updated the class diagram to reflect some design changes. The `Checkers` class is now a factory, to simplify instance creation to final users without the need to expose some classes to clients.

Note: The classes `GameLog` and `Score` are not the same.
