# Introduction

Please note: This project was discontinued.

Checkers is a simple engine to create a checkers game. It will come with some features, such as:

 * Scores per game and global
 * Game logging (moves, in-game changes, etc.) with easy translation support
 * Easy game integration (choose between an event-driven or sequential paradigm for your application)
 * Small file footprint (under 100KB compiled dll)
 * And of course, all things you need to create a two players checkers game! 

Feel free to check and use the source code.
