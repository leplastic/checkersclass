Checkers is a simple engine to create a checkers game. It will come with some features, such as:

  * Scores per game and global
  * Game logging (moves, in-game changes, etc.) with easy translation support
  * Easy game integration (choose between an event-driven or sequential paradigm for your application)
  * Small file footprint (under 100KB compiled dll)
  * And of course, all things you need to create a two players checkers game!

The class is still at the beginning of development. For now, there are no download links, so feel free to check the source.
